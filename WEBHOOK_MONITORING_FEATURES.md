# Webhook Monitoring Features Added

## Overview
Enhanced the ML Intelligence Hub with real-time webhook monitoring to track TradingView signal flow.

## Features Added

### 1. Connection Status Banner (Top of Dashboard)
- **Live connection indicator** with animated pulse
- **Color-coded status:**
  - üü¢ Green: Signals flowing (< 5 minutes since last signal)
  - üü° Yellow: Warning (5-15 minutes since last signal)
  - üî¥ Red: Disconnected (> 15 minutes since last signal)
  - ‚è≥ Gray: Waiting for first signal

- **Quick stats display:**
  - Last signal time (e.g., "2m ago")
  - Total signals in last 24 hours
  - Current health status emoji

### 2. Enhanced Signal Reception Monitor
- **Detailed time tracking:**
  - Shows exact time since last signal
  - Color-coded status indicator dot
  - Full timestamp display
  
- **Separate tracking for:**
  - Bullish signals count & last received time
  - Bearish signals count & last received time
  
- **Health monitoring:**
  - Automatic detection of signal gaps
  - Alerts for missing signal types
  - Real-time health status updates

### 3. Auto-Refresh & Notifications
- **Fast refresh rate:** Updates every 10 seconds
- **Browser notifications:** Alerts when connection degrades
- **State change detection:** Only notifies on status changes
- **Permission request:** Asks for notification permission on load

### 4. Visual Feedback
- **Animated pulse:** Indicates active connection
- **Color transitions:** Smooth status changes
- **Responsive design:** Works on mobile and desktop

## How It Works

### Status Thresholds
```
< 5 minutes   = ‚úÖ Healthy (Green pulse)
5-15 minutes  = ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning (Yellow pulse)
> 15 minutes  = ‚ùå Disconnected (Red pulse)
No signals    = ‚è≥ Waiting (Gray, no pulse)
```

### API Endpoints Used
- `/api/webhook-stats` - Signal counts and timestamps
- `/api/webhook-health` - Health alerts
- `/api/signal-gap-check` - Gap detection

### Refresh Schedule
- **Webhook stats:** Every 10 seconds
- **ML data:** Every 60 seconds
- **Live predictions:** Every 60 seconds

## Benefits

1. **Immediate visibility** - Know instantly if TradingView webhooks stop
2. **No browser required** - TradingView alerts run 24/7 on their servers
3. **Proactive alerts** - Get notified before you lose trading opportunities
4. **Historical tracking** - See 24-hour signal counts
5. **Bias monitoring** - Ensure both bullish and bearish signals are flowing

## Usage

1. **Open ML Intelligence Hub:** `https://web-production-cd33.up.railway.app/ml-dashboard`
2. **Check the banner at top:** Shows real-time connection status
3. **Monitor the pulse:** Green = good, Yellow = check soon, Red = investigate
4. **Enable notifications:** Allow browser notifications for alerts

## Troubleshooting

### If status shows "Disconnected":
1. Check TradingView alert is active (green dot in alerts list)
2. Verify webhook URL is correct in alert settings
3. Check Railway server is running (visit /health endpoint)
4. Review server logs for webhook errors
5. Test with manual signal from TradingView

### If status shows "Waiting":
1. No signals received yet - this is normal on first load
2. Wait for next bias change on your chart
3. Or manually trigger a test signal

## Next Steps

Consider adding:
- Email/SMS alerts for extended disconnections
- Backup signal generation (see `backup_signal_generator.py`)
- Webhook retry mechanism
- Signal quality metrics
- Multi-symbol monitoring

## Files Modified
- `ml_feature_dashboard.html` - Added connection banner and enhanced monitoring
- `web_server.py` - Fixed price variable bug in webhook handler

## Deploy Instructions
1. Commit changes: `git add . && git commit -m "Add webhook monitoring"`
