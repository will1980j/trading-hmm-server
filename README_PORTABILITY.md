railway variables set OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
railway variables set SECRET_KEY=your-secret-here
```

## 🧪 Verify Setup
```bash
python check_env.py  # Check environment variables
python web_server.py # Start local server
```

## 📱 Development Workflow

### From Any Machine:
1. `git pull` latest changes
2. Run your local server
3. Chrome extension connects automatically
4. Deploy with `railway deploy`

### No Machine-Specific Dependencies!
