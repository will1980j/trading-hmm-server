# Prop Firm Selector Feature - Complete

## ‚úÖ What Was Added

### **New Prop Firm Section**
Added between the filter inputs and "Best Of" section with 8 major futures prop firms:

1. **Apex Trader Funding** - 3% daily loss, 6% trailing DD
2. **TopStep** - 4% daily loss, 4% max loss
3. **Earn2Trade** - 4% daily loss, 8% max DD
4. **TakeProfit Trader** - 3% daily loss, 6% max DD
5. **Bulenox** - 5% daily loss, 10% max DD (most lenient)
6. **TradeDay** - 3% daily loss, 6% trailing DD
7. **Lux Trading Firm** - 4% daily loss, 8% max DD
8. **NinjaTrader** - 2.5% daily loss, 5% max DD (strictest)

## üéØ How It Works

### **Automatic Rule Application:**
1. User checks one or more prop firm checkboxes
2. System identifies the **strictest rules** among selected firms
3. Automatically updates the filter inputs:
   - Max Daily Loss (%)
   - Max Drawdown (%)
4. Shows active rules summary below checkboxes
5. When "Run Comparison" is clicked, only strategies meeting those rules are shown

### **Multi-Firm Selection:**
- Can select multiple firms at once
- System applies the **strictest** rule from all selected firms
- Example: Select Apex (3% daily) + NinjaTrader (2.5% daily) = Uses 2.5%

### **Visual Feedback:**
- Info box appears when firms are selected
- Shows which firms are active
- Displays the strictest rules being applied
- Confirms filters have been updated
