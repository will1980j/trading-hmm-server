## Key Features of Phase E.5

### Purpose

**Bridge Phase:** Between analytics completion (Phase E) and strategy construction (Phase F)

**Focus:** Polish and performance, not new features

**Timing:** Before moving to strategy work, ensure the UI is professional and performant

### Scope Restrictions

**Allowed:**
- UI/UX improvements
- Performance optimizations
- Visual consistency
- Typography and spacing
- State indicators

**Prohibited:**
- New signal logic
- ML/AI additions
- Strategy changes
- Backtesting features
- Analytics enhancements

### Video Background Policy

**Clear Guidance:**
- Remove or replace video backgrounds
- Use static/lightweight assets instead
- Prioritize clarity over aesthetics
- Optimize for fast load times
- Reduce distraction

**Rationale:**
- Professional trading systems need clarity
- Performance matters for real-time decisions
- Heavy visual effects slow page load
- Static assets are more reliable

## Summary

Phase E.5 (Production Readiness & UX Polish) has been successfully added to the roadmap between Phase E and Phase F. The phase includes:

- 6 specific deliverables focused on UI/UX polish
- Clear rules prohibiting feature additions
- Video background removal guidance
