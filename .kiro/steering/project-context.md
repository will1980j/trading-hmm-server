# NASDAQ Day Trading Analytics Platform - Development Context

## Project Overview

I have a comprehensive cloud-based NASDAQ day trading analytics platform built with Amazon Q assistance, deployed at `web-production-cd33.up.railway.app/`. This is a multi-faceted trading platform designed to optimize scalping strategies on the NASDAQ using advanced analytics, real-time data processing, and machine learning as one of several key features. 

**The eventual goal is to build a system that helps grow a prop firm trading business and leverage cloud-based automation, AI and machine learning to collect data, analyze trading signals, and establish a trading edge like none that has ever existed before.**
