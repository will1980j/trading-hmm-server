## Project Overview

I have a comprehensive cloud-based NASDAQ day trading analytics platform built with Amazon Q assistance, deployed at `web-production-cd33.up.railway.app/`. This is a multi-faceted trading platform designed to optimize scalping strategies on the NASDAQ using advanced analytics, real-time data processing, and machine learning as one of several key features.

## üö® **CRITICAL CLOUD-FIRST DEVELOPMENT RULE** üö®

**‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER USE LOCAL RESOURCES - EVERYTHING MUST BE CLOUD-BASED ‚ö†Ô∏è**

### **MANDATORY CLOUD-FIRST PRINCIPLES:**

1. **üö´ NO LOCAL DATABASE CONNECTIONS**
   - Never connect to `localhost:5432` or local PostgreSQL
   - Always use Railway's `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
   - All database operations must work on Railway cloud infrastructure

2. **üö´ NO LOCAL FILE STORAGE**
   - No local file writes outside of temporary processing
   - No local image/data storage that persists
   - Use cloud storage solutions for any persistent data

3. **üö´ NO LOCAL DEPENDENCIES**
   - All features must work on Railway's cloud environment
   - No local-only libraries or system dependencies
   - Test all functionality on production Railway deployment

4. **üö´ NO LOCAL TESTING ASSUMPTIONS**
   - If it doesn't work on Railway, it doesn't work
   - Local testing is for development only - not validation
   - Production Railway environment is the source of truth

5. **‚úÖ CLOUD-FIRST IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:**
   - All API endpoints must be accessible from Railway
   - All database queries must use Railway PostgreSQL
   - All ML training must happen on Railway infrastructure
   - All real-time features must work in cloud environment
   - All authentication must work with Railway deployment

### **DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW:**
1. **Develop locally** for speed and iteration
2. **Commit via GitHub Desktop** - stage changes and commit with descriptive messages
3. **Push to main branch** - triggers automatic Railway deployment
4. **Validate on production** - if it fails there, it's broken
5. **Never rely on local-only functionality**

### **DEPLOYMENT PROCESS:**
- **Tool:** GitHub Desktop (GUI-based Git client)
- **Method:** Commit ‚Üí Push ‚Üí Auto-deploy to Railway
- **Timeline:** Deployment typically completes within 2-3 minutes
- **Monitoring:** Railway dashboard shows build status and logs

### **TESTING PRIORITY:**
- **Primary:** Production Railway testing (`web-production-cd33.up.railway.app`)
- **Secondary:** Local development (for iteration only)
- **Rule:** If Railway fails, local success is irrelevant

**This platform serves real traders with real money - cloud reliability is non-negotiable!**

## üö® **CRITICAL NO FAKE DATA RULE** üö®

**‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER USE FALLBACK, SAMPLE, OR SIMULATION DATA ‚ö†Ô∏è**

## üö® **CRITICAL TRADING METHODOLOGY RULE** üö®

**‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER SIMPLIFY OR MODIFY THE EXACT TRADING METHODOLOGY ‚ö†Ô∏è**

### **MANDATORY METHODOLOGY PRINCIPLES:**

1. **üö´ NO SIMPLIFIED IMPLEMENTATIONS**
   - Never use placeholder logic like "signal_price + 2.5"
   - Never use arbitrary buffers like "signal_price - 25"
   - Never skip confirmation requirements
   - Never ignore pivot detection logic

2. **üö´ NO SHORTCUTS OR APPROXIMATIONS**
   - Must implement EXACT confirmation candle logic
   - Must implement EXACT pivot point detection
   - Must implement EXACT stop loss methodology
   - Must implement EXACT session filtering

3. **üö´ NO "SIMPLIFIED FOR NOW" BULLSHIT**
   - If the full methodology can't be implemented, DON'T implement it
   - Better to have no automation than wrong automation
   - Never deploy incomplete methodology as "temporary"
   - Never use "we'll enhance it later" as an excuse

4. **‚úÖ EXACT METHODOLOGY IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:**
   - Follow the EXACT bullish/bearish confirmation process
   - Use the EXACT pivot detection algorithm (3-candle pivot rules)
   - Implement the EXACT stop loss placement logic
   - Use the EXACT session timing validation
   - Implement the EXACT signal cancellation rules

### **THE METHODOLOGY IS SACRED:**
- **Every detail matters** - No exceptions
- **Every rule must be followed** - No shortcuts  
- **Every calculation must be exact** - No approximations
- **Every condition must be checked** - No skipping

### **CONSEQUENCES OF VIOLATING THIS RULE:**
- **Destroys trading edge** - Wrong methodology = wrong results
- **Wastes real money** - Traders rely on this for actual trades
- **Breaks trust** - System becomes unreliable
- **Corrupts data** - Wrong signals pollute analytics

**RULE: If you can't implement the EXACT methodology, don't implement anything at all!**

## üö® **CRITICAL USER CONSULTATION RULE** üö®

**‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER CHANGE USER REQUIREMENTS WITHOUT EXPLICIT CONSULTATION ‚ö†Ô∏è**

### **MANDATORY CONSULTATION PRINCIPLES:**

1. **üö´ NO UNILATERAL DECISIONS**
   - Never change the user's specific requirements
   - Never substitute alternatives without asking first
   - Never assume what the user "really wants"
   - Never make compromises without explicit approval

2. **üö´ NO TECHNICAL EXCUSES**
   - If something doesn't work, find a solution - don't change the requirement
   - If CORS blocks videos, find videos that work - don't switch to CSS
   - If APIs fail, find working APIs - don't build fallbacks
   - Technical limitations require solutions, not requirement changes

3. **‚úÖ REQUIRED CONSULTATION APPROACH:**
   - **Ask first:** "The videos aren't working due to CORS. Should I find different video sources or would you prefer another approach?"
   - **Present options:** Give multiple solutions that meet the original requirement
   - **Wait for approval:** Don't implement until user confirms the approach
   - **Stay true to intent:** Honor the user's original vision

4. **‚úÖ WHEN USER SAYS "VIDEOS" THEY MEAN VIDEOS:**
   - Find working video sources
   - Solve CORS issues
   - Use different video providers
   - Create video hosting solutions
   - **NEVER substitute with CSS animations**

### **VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES:**
- **Breaks user trust** - User loses confidence in assistant
- **Wastes time** - Forces rework and corrections
- **Ignores expertise** - User knows their requirements best
- **Creates frustration** - User has to constantly correct decisions

**RULE: Always consult before changing ANY user requirement - no exceptions!**

### **MANDATORY REAL DATA PRINCIPLES:**

1. **üö´ NO FALLBACK DATA**
   - Never show placeholder data when real data fails to load
   - Never use "sample" or "demo" data to fill empty states
   - If data is missing, show an error - don't fake it

2. **üö´ NO SIMULATION DATA**
   - No mock trading signals or fake market data
   - No simulated P&L or performance metrics
   - No artificial trading history or backtests with fake results

3. **üö´ NO SAMPLE DATA**
   - No hardcoded example trades or signals
   - No placeholder charts with fake price movements
   - No dummy user data or synthetic performance stats

4. **üö´ NO DEFAULT VALUES MASQUERADING AS REAL DATA**
   - Don't show "0.00" as if it's a real profit/loss
   - Don't display empty charts as if they contain data
   - Don't show "loading..." indefinitely to hide missing data

### **‚úÖ PROPER ERROR HANDLING INSTEAD:**

1. **Show Clear Error Messages:**
   - "No trading data available - connect your data source"
   - "ML models not trained - insufficient historical data"
   - "Database connection failed - check system status"

2. **Display Empty States Honestly:**
   - "No signals received today"
   - "No completed trades to analyze"
   - "Prediction accuracy unavailable - no predictions made"

3. **Provide Actionable Solutions:**
   - "Add trading data to enable analysis"
   - "Complete 30+ trades to train ML models"
   - "Check TradingView webhook configuration"

### **WHY THIS MATTERS:**
- **Real Money:** Traders make decisions based on this data
- **Trust:** Fake data destroys credibility and confidence
- **Debugging:** Real errors lead to real solutions
- **Accuracy:** Better to show nothing than show lies

### **DEVELOPMENT APPROACH:**
- **If data is missing:** Show error and fix the root cause
- **If API fails:** Display failure message and investigate
- **If calculation fails:** Show "calculation error" not fake results
- **If no data exists:** Clearly state "no data available"

**RULE: Better to have an honest empty dashboard than a lying full one!**

## üéØ **THE HOLY GRAIL: AUTOMATED SIGNAL VALIDATION** üéØ

### **Current Signal Processing Workflow:**

**üîµ TradingView Indicator ‚Üí Manual Validation ‚Üí Signal Lab Entry ‚Üí Platform Analytics**

1. **Custom TradingView Indicator:**
   - **Blue Triangles:** Long/Bullish signals
   - **Red Triangles:** Short/Bearish signals
   - Sends ALL signals via webhook to platform

2. **Manual Validation Process (Current):**
   - Visual verification of multiple criteria
   - Human judgment on signal validity
   - Manual determination of correct MFE values
   - Only VALID signals get entered into Signal Lab

3. **Signal Lab (Manual Entry):**
   - Manually input validated signal details
   - Record actual trade outcomes and MFE
   - This data feeds ALL platform strategy metrics

4. **Platform Analytics:**
   - All dashboards, ML models, and insights
   - Based entirely on manually curated Signal Lab data
   - High quality but limited by manual processing speed

### **THE AUTOMATION GOAL:**

**üöÄ Replace Manual Validation with Intelligent Automation**

- **Compound Advantage:** Each signal makes the entire system smarter

**Every validated signal today becomes tomorrow's competitive advantage!** üìàüß†üíé

## üéØ **CORE TRADING METHODOLOGY** üéØ

### **Signal Source & Automation Goal:**
- **TradingView Indicator:** Custom indicator generates blue triangles (bullish) and red triangles (bearish)
- **Current Process:** Manual validation and Signal Lab entry
- **Automation Goal:** Intelligent automated signal validation and processing

### **üîµ BULLISH TRADE METHODOLOGY:**

#### **Signal Confirmation:**
1. **Signal Generation:** Blue triangle appears on candle (signal candle)
2. **Confirmation Requirement:** Wait for bullish candle to close **above** signal candle's **high**
3. **Timing:** No time limit - wait indefinitely for confirmation
4. **Cancellation Rule:** Red triangle cancels pending bullish signal

#### **Trade Entry:**
1. **Entry Trigger:** First bullish candle closes above signal candle high
2. **Entry Execution:** Enter LONG at **open** of following candle
3. **Entry Logic:** `entry_price = next_candle.open`

#### **Stop Loss Methodology:**
1. **Define Range:** From signal candle **low** to confirmation candle
2. **Find Lowest Point:** Identify candle with lowest low in range
3. **Stop Loss Placement:**
   - **Scenario A:** Lowest point is 3-candle pivot ‚Üí SL = pivot low - 25pts
   - **Scenario B:** Lowest point is signal candle (and is pivot) ‚Üí SL = signal low - 25pts  
   - **Scenario C:** Lowest point is signal candle (not pivot) ‚Üí Search left 5 candles for pivot
     - If pivot found: SL = pivot low - 25pts
     - If no pivot: SL = first bearish candle low - 25pts (after 5-candle search)

### **üî¥ BEARISH TRADE METHODOLOGY:**

#### **Signal Confirmation:**
1. **Signal Generation:** Red triangle appears on candle (signal candle)
2. **Confirmation Requirement:** Wait for bearish candle to close **below** signal candle's **low**
3. **Timing:** No time limit - wait indefinitely for confirmation
4. **Cancellation Rule:** Blue triangle cancels pending bearish signal

#### **Trade Entry:**
1. **Entry Trigger:** First bearish candle closes below signal candle low
2. **Entry Execution:** Enter SHORT at **open** of following candle
3. **Entry Logic:** `entry_price = next_candle.open`

#### **Stop Loss Methodology:**
1. **Define Range:** From signal candle **high** to confirmation candle
2. **Find Highest Point:** Identify candle with highest high in range
3. **Stop Loss Placement:**
   - **Scenario A:** Highest point is 3-candle pivot ‚Üí SL = pivot high + 25pts
   - **Scenario B:** Highest point is signal candle (and is pivot) ‚Üí SL = signal high + 25pts
   - **Scenario C:** Highest point is signal candle (not pivot) ‚Üí Search left 5 candles for pivot
     - If pivot found: SL = pivot high + 25pts
     - If no pivot: SL = first bullish candle high + 25pts (after 5-candle search)

### **üìä KEY DEFINITIONS:**

#### **3-Candle Pivot:**
- **Bullish Pivot:** Candle low < both adjacent candle lows
- **Bearish Pivot:** Candle high > both adjacent candle highs

#### **Signal Cancellation:**
- Opposing signal (red/blue triangle) cancels pending confirmation
- Only one active signal at a time

#### **üïê SESSION FILTERING (CRITICAL):**
**ONLY signals within established trading sessions are considered valid**

**Valid Trading Sessions (US Eastern Time - TradingView Reference):**

**Current Sessions (EDT - UTC-4):**
- **ASIA:** 20:00-23:59 (Asian market overlap)
- **LONDON:** 00:00-05:59 (London market hours)
- **NY PRE:** 06:00-08:29 (Pre-market trading)
- **NY AM:** 08:30-11:59 (Morning session - market open to lunch)
- **NY LUNCH:** 12:00-12:59 (Lunch hour)
- **NY PM:** 13:00-15:59 (Afternoon session - lunch to close)

**Winter Sessions (EST - UTC-5):**
- **ASIA:** 20:00-23:59 (Same times)
- **LONDON:** 00:00-05:59 (Same times)

**Note:** Session times remain constant in Eastern Time regardless of DST

**Invalid Signal Times:**
- **16:00-19:59 Eastern Time** (Extremely low volatility period)
- **Any time outside defined sessions:** Automatically rejected

**DST Transition Dates (US):**
- **Spring Forward:** Second Sunday in March (2:00 AM ‚Üí 3:00 AM)
- **Fall Back:** First Sunday in November (2:00 AM ‚Üí 1:00 AM)

**Automation Rule (TradingView Compatible):**
```python
import pytz
from datetime import datetime

def is_valid_session(signal_timestamp):
    # Convert to US Eastern Time (matches TradingView)
    eastern = pytz.timezone('US/Eastern')
    et_time = signal_timestamp.astimezone(eastern)
    hour = et_time.hour
    minute = et_time.minute
    
    # Session validation (constant Eastern Time - matches TradingView)
    if 20 <= hour <= 23:  # ASIA: 20:00-23:59
        return True, "ASIA"
    elif hour == 0 or (1 <= hour <= 5):  # LONDON: 00:00-05:59
        return True, "LONDON"
    elif hour == 6 or (hour == 8 and minute <= 29):  # NY PRE: 06:00-08:29
        return True, "NY PRE"
    elif (hour == 8 and minute >= 30) or (9 <= hour <= 11):  # NY AM: 08:30-11:59
        return True, "NY AM"
    elif hour == 12 and minute <= 59:  # NY LUNCH: 12:00-12:59
        return True, "NY LUNCH"
    elif 13 <= hour <= 15:  # NY PM: 13:00-15:59
        return True, "NY PM"
    else:
        return False, "INVALID"  # Reject: 16:00-19:59 + overnight gaps

# Usage
is_valid, session = is_valid_session(signal_timestamp)
if not is_valid:
    REJECT_SIGNAL()
else:
    PROCESS_SIGNAL(session)
```

#### **NASDAQ Specifications:**
- **Buffer Distance:** Always 25 points
- **Instrument:** NASDAQ only
- **Timeframe:** 1-minute charts (primary)

### **üîÑ AUTOMATION PIPELINE (Target):**
```
TradingView Signal ‚Üí Automated Validation ‚Üí Signal Lab Entry ‚Üí Real-Time Analytics
```

### **ÔøΩ RISKI-TO-REWARD SYSTEM:**

#### **Core R-Multiple Concept:**
- **Stop Loss Position:** Always equals **-1R** (risk unit)
- **Entry to Stop Loss Distance:** Defines 1R unit size
- **All targets measured in R-multiples** from entry point

#### **Position Sizing & Risk:**
- **Risk Management:** Apply % risk to account size
- **Position Size:** Calculated based on 1R distance and risk %
- **Consistent Risk:** Every trade risks same % regardless of stop distance

#### **Break Even Strategies:**

**BE = 1 (Break Even Active):**
- **Trigger:** When price moves +1R from entry (total 2R from stop loss)
- **Action:** Move stop loss to entry point (**0R = Break Even**)
- **Protection:** Eliminates risk once +1R achieved
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Commission Cost:** Still pay commissions on breakeven trades - too many BEs erode profits

**BE = None (No Break Even):**
- **Behavior:** Stop loss remains at original -1R position
- **Risk:** Price can fluctuate between -1R and +targets
- **Exit:** Only via stop loss (-1R) or profit target achievement

#### **üéØ AUTOMATION OPPORTUNITIES:**

**Critical Missing Data - Price Level Capture:**
- **Current Gap:** Signal Lab lacks price level fields
- **Manual Limitation:** Too time-consuming to capture manually
- **Automation Value:** Automated price capture would provide incredible accuracy
- **Historical Data:** Existing trades have R-data but no price levels

**Proposed Price Level Fields for Signal Lab:**
- **Entry Price:** Actual entry execution price
- **Stop Loss Price:** Calculated stop loss price level
- **Break Even Price:** Entry price (for BE=1 strategies)
- **Target Prices:** Multiple R-target price levels (1R, 2R, 3R, etc.)

#### **üîÑ Automated Price Calculation Logic:**

**For Bullish Trades:**
```
entry_price = confirmation_candle_next.open
stop_loss_price = calculated_pivot_low - 25_points
risk_distance = entry_price - stop_loss_price
target_1R = entry_price + risk_distance
target_2R = entry_price + (2 * risk_distance)
target_3R = entry_price + (3 * risk_distance)
...
target_20R = entry_price + (20 * risk_distance)  # Ultimate trend target
break_even_trigger = target_1R
```

**For Bearish Trades:**
```
entry_price = confirmation_candle_next.open
stop_loss_price = calculated_pivot_high + 25_points  
risk_distance = stop_loss_price - entry_price
target_1R = entry_price - risk_distance
target_2R = entry_price - (2 * risk_distance)
target_3R = entry_price - (3 * risk_distance)
...
target_20R = entry_price - (20 * risk_distance)  # Ultimate trend target
break_even_trigger = target_1R
```

### **üìä MFE CALCULATION METHODOLOGY:**

#### **Maximum Favorable Excursion Definition:**
**MFE = Highest R-multiple achieved from entry point before trade resolution**

#### **MFE Tracking Logic:**

**For Bullish Trades:**
- **Track:** Highest positive R-multiple reached from entry
- **Resolution Events:** Stop Loss hit OR Break Even triggered
- **Calculation:** `MFE = (highest_price - entry_price) / (entry_price - stop_loss_price)`

**For Bearish Trades:**
- **Track:** Highest positive R-multiple reached from entry  
- **Resolution Events:** Stop Loss hit OR Break Even triggered
- **Calculation:** `MFE = (entry_price - lowest_price) / (stop_loss_price - entry_price)`

#### **Trade Status Categories:**

**Resolved Trades:**
- **Ended by:** Stop Loss hit OR Break Even triggered
- **MFE Status:** Final/Fixed value
- **Backtesting:** Ready for analysis with complete MFE data

**Active Trades:**
- **Status:** Still running (no SL/BE hit yet)
- **MFE Status:** Dynamic - updates as new highs/lows achieved
- **Backtesting:** Can use current MFE for analysis (valid data)
- **Challenge:** May run for extended periods during strong trends

#### **Special Considerations:**

**No Break Even Strategies (BE = None):**
- **Resolution:** Only via Stop Loss
- **Duration:** Can remain active indefinitely
- **MFE Updates:** Continuous until SL hit

**Break Even Strategies (BE = 1):**
- **Resolution:** Stop Loss OR +1R achievement (triggers BE)
- **Duration:** Limited by BE trigger
- **MFE Tracking:** Stops updating once BE triggered

#### **üîÑ Dynamic MFE System Requirements:**
- **Real-time price monitoring** for active trades
- **Automatic MFE updates** when new extremes reached
- **Trade status tracking** (Active vs Resolved)
- **Historical MFE preservation** when trades resolve
- **Backtesting compatibility** with both active and resolved trades

### **üöÄ NEXT AUTOMATION PRIORITIES:**
1. **Add price level fields** to Signal Lab database
2. **Implement automated price calculations** based on your methodology
3. **Capture real-time price data** for accurate R-multiple tracking
4. **Enhance MFE calculations** with precise price levels
5. **Build break-even logic** into backtesting system

**This R-multiple system with automated price capture would transform data accuracy and enable sophisticated risk management!** üéØüíéüìà 

**The eventual goal is to build a system that helps grow a prop firm trading business and leverage cloud-based automation, AI and machine learning to collect data, analyze trading signals, and establish a trading edge like none that has ever existed before.**

## üéØ **CORE TRADING INDICATOR - EXACT SIGNAL LOGIC**

### **Master Indicator: Live FVG/IFVG Signal with HTF Bias + Engulfing**

**This is the EXACT signal logic that drives the entire V2 automation system. DO NOT CHANGE ANY LOGIC.**

**Signal Generation Logic:**
- **FVG/IFVG Bias Detection:** Complex Fair Value Gap and Inverse Fair Value Gap analysis
- **HTF Alignment:** Multi-timeframe bias confirmation (Daily, 4H, 1H, 15M, 5M)
- **Engulfing Filters:** Optional engulfing candle pattern requirements
- **Signal Triggers:** Bias change from Neutral ‚Üí Bullish/Bearish with optional filters

**Key Signal Conditions:**
```pinescript
// BULLISH SIGNAL: bias changes to "Bullish" AND passes all filters
fvg_bull_signal = bias != bias[1] and bias == "Bullish" and (not htf_aligned_only or htf_bullish)

// BEARISH SIGNAL: bias changes to "Bearish" AND passes all filters  
fvg_bear_signal = bias != bias[1] and bias == "Bearish" and (not htf_aligned_only or htf_bearish)

// ENGULFING FILTERS (priority: sweep > regular > none)
show_bull_triangle = require_sweep_engulfing ? (fvg_bull_signal and bullish_sweep_engulfing) : 
                    require_engulfing ? (fvg_bull_signal and bullish_engulfing) : 
                    fvg_bull_signal

show_bear_triangle = require_sweep_engulfing ? (fvg_bear_signal and bearish_sweep_engulfing) : 
                    require_engulfing ? (fvg_bear_signal and bearish_engulfing) : 
                    fvg_bear_signal
```

**Current Webhook Format:**
```
SIGNAL:Bullish:4156.25:85.0:1H:Bullish 15M:Bullish 5M:Bullish:FVG:1698765432000
```

**Default Settings (from image):**
- **HTF Bias Filter:** Daily=OFF, 4H=OFF, 1H=ON, 15M=ON, 5M=ON
- **Signal Filter:** FVG + Engulfing Only=OFF, FVG + Sweep Engulfing Only=OFF
- **Display:** Show HTF Status=ON, HTF Aligned Triangles Only=ON, Triangle Size=Small
- **Table Position:** Bottom Right
- **Colors:** Bullish=Blue, Bearish=Red/Pink, Neutral=Gray

**CRITICAL:** This indicator logic is the foundation of the entire V2 automation system. Any enhanced version MUST preserve this exact signal generation logic while adding comprehensive data output for methodology automation.

2. **Real-Time Performance** - Sub-second latency for scalping requirements
3. **Professional UI/UX** - Modern, responsive design across all pages
4. **Signal Reliability** - 100% signal reception and processing accuracy
5. **Advanced Analytics** - Sophisticated trading intelligence and insights

## Key Constraints

- Optimized for NASDAQ scalping strategies (not long-term investing)
- Real-time performance requirements (<1 second latency)
- Professional trading environment styling
- Mobile-responsive for active trading scenarios
- Seamless integration with existing TradingView workflows

## Performance Metrics Guidelines

**‚ùå AVOID These Metrics for Scalping Systems:**
- **Sharpe Ratio** - Misleading for short-term trading due to volatility calculations
- **Sortino Ratio** - Inappropriate for scalping timeframes and frequency
- **Risk-Adjusted Returns** - Distorted by the high-frequency nature of scalping

**‚úÖ USE These Scalping-Appropriate Metrics:**
- **Profit Factor** - Gross profit vs gross loss ratio
- **Win Rate** - Critical for scalping success assessment
- **Expectancy** - Average profit per trade
- **Recovery Factor** - Total return divided by maximum drawdown
- **Maximum Consecutive Losses** - Essential for position sizing
- **Maximum Win/Loss Streaks** - Psychological preparation metrics
- **Risk:Reward Ratio** - Average win vs average loss comparison

**Rationale:** Sharpe and Sortino ratios assume normal return distributions and longer holding periods. Scalping strategies have unique characteristics (high frequency, short duration, different risk profiles) that make traditional risk-adjusted metrics misleading and potentially harmful for decision-making.
