## Capability vs Permission

### System Capabilities (Built, Not Permitted)

The system CAN technically support:
- ✅ Multi-symbol (NQ, ES, YM, RTY, CL, GC, etc.) - Registry exists
- ✅ Multi-timeframe (1m, 5m, 15m, 1h, 4h, daily) - HTF modules exist
- ✅ Automated execution - Infrastructure exists

### Execution Permissions (Locked)

The system MAY ONLY execute:
- ✅ NQ (NASDAQ-100 E-mini)
- ✅ 1-minute timeframe
- ✅ Manual signal validation

**All expansion is PROHIBITED until Phase E criteria are met.**

## Enforcement

### Kiro Must:
- ❌ NOT implement multi-symbol features
- ❌ NOT implement multi-timeframe features
- ❌ NOT implement automation features
- ✅ Focus exclusively on NQ 1-minute edge validation
- ✅ Respect Phase E scope limitations
- ✅ Request user approval before any expansion work

### User Must:
- ✅ Explicitly approve Phase E completion
- ✅ Confirm all expansion gate criteria met
- ✅ Unlock each expansion phase individually
- ✅ Maintain focus discipline

## Rationale

**Why Lock Expansion:**
1. **Focus is essential** - Dilution kills edges
2. **Prove before scale** - Unproven strategies waste capital
3. **Risk management** - Expansion multiplies risk
4. **Resource allocation** - Limited attention must be focused
5. **Psychological load** - Complexity increases errors

**Expansion without proven edge is premature optimization.**

---

**Status:** Phase E is ACTIVE. All expansion phases are LOCKED until Phase E criteria met.
