## You Do Nothing!

ML manages itself:
- Trains when needed
- Retrains to stay current
- Improves as you trade
- Zero manual intervention

## After Deploy

You'll see:
- Status: "Not Trained" (initially)
- First signal triggers auto-training
- Status changes to "Trained" ✅
- ML works forever automatically
