# 🚀 DEPLOY AUTOMATED SIGNALS DASHBOARDS NOW

## The Problem
The dashboards are built locally but NOT deployed to Railway yet.

## The Solution
You need to commit and push the files using GitHub Desktop.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Open GitHub Desktop

### 2. You should see these files as "Changes":
- `web_server.py`
- `templates/automated_signals_dashboard.html`
- `templates/automated_signals_dashboard_option2.html`
- `templates/automated_signals_dashboard_option3.html`

### 3. Stage all files (check the boxes)

### 4. Commit with message:
```
Add 3 automated signals dashboard options
```

### 5. Click "Push origin" button

### 6. Wait 2-3 minutes for Railway to deploy

### 7. Then visit:
- **Option 1:** https://web-production-cd33.up.railway.app/automated-signals
- **Option 2:** https://web-production-cd33.up.railway.app/automated-signals-analytics
- **Option 3:** https://web-production-cd33.up.railway.app/automated-signals-command

## That's It!

The dashboards are ready - they just need to be pushed to Railway.
