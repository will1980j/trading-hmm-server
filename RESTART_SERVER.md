# Server Restart Required

The hyperparameter optimization integration has been completed. To activate the new `/api/hyperparameter-status` endpoint, you need to restart your Flask server.

## What Was Added:

1. ✅ `/api/hyperparameter-status` endpoint in web_server.py (line 4902)
2. ✅ Database table auto-initialization on startup
3. ✅ ml_auto_optimizer.py now stores results in database
4. ✅ Dashboard updated to display optimization status

## To Restart:

**On Railway:**
- The server will auto-restart on next deployment
- Or manually restart from Railway dashboard

**Local Development:**
- Stop the current Flask process (Ctrl+C)
- Run: `python web_server.py`

## After Restart:

Visit `/ml-dashboard` and you should see:
- ⚙️ Hyperparameter Optimization Status section
- Shows "⏳ Optimization Pending" until first optimization runs
- After optimization: Shows optimized parameters and performance improvements

## Troubleshooting:

If you still see 404 after restart:
1. Check server logs for any import errors
2. Verify `hyperparameter_status.py` is in the root directory
3. Check that database connection is working
