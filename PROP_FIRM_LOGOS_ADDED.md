## üìù Future Enhancements (Optional)

If you want even better logos later, you can:
1. Download high-res logos from each firm's press kit
2. Save to `/static/logos/` folder
3. Replace Google favicon URLs with local paths
4. Get consistent sizing and quality

But the current implementation works great and requires no manual work!
