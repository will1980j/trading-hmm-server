# Webhook Signal Debugging System

## Quick Start

### 1. Setup (One-time)
```bash
# Run setup script
setup_webhook_debug.bat

# Or manually:
python init_webhook_debug.py
```

### 2. Start Server
```bash
python web_server.py
```

### 3. Open Monitoring Dashboard
Navigate to: `http://localhost:5000/webhook-monitor`

### 4. Test Signal Reception
Click the test buttons in the dashboard:
- üü¢ Test Bullish Signal
- üî¥ Test Bearish Signal

Both should appear immediately in the signal log.

## Debugging Workflow

### Problem: Only Bullish Signals Received

#### Step 1: Verify Server Reception
1. Open `/webhook-monitor`
2. Check signal counts
3. Click "Test Bearish Signal"
4. Verify it appears in logs

**If test works:** Problem is in TradingView configuration
**If test fails:** Problem is in server code

#### Step 2: Check TradingView Configuration
1. Open TradingView alert settings
2. Verify alert condition triggers on BOTH bias changes
3. Check alert message format:
```javascript
{
  "bias": "{{plot("bias")}}",
  "price": {{close}},
  "symbol": "{{ticker}}"
}
```
4. Ensure webhook URL is correct: `https://your-server.com/api/live-signals`

#### Step 3: Monitor Real-Time Logs
```bash
# Terminal 1: Follow webhook logs
python webhook_log_viewer.py follow

# Terminal 2: Watch server logs
tail -f server.log | grep "WEBHOOK"
```

Look for:
- üî• WEBHOOK RECEIVED: [shows raw data]
- üìä PARSED SIGNAL: bias=Bearish [shows parsed data]
- ‚úÖ Signal stored: [shows successful storage]

#### Step 4: Check Database
```sql
-- Should show both signal types
SELECT bias, COUNT(*) as count, MAX(timestamp) as last_signal
FROM live_signals
WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
GROUP BY bias;
```

Expected result:
```
bias     | count | last_signal
---------|-------|------------------
Bullish  | 12    | 2024-01-15 14:30
Bearish  | 10    | 2024-01-15 14:28
```

#### Step 5: Review Failures
```bash
# Check failed signals
python webhook_log_viewer.py processing
```

Look for error messages that indicate why bearish signals might be failing.

## Common Issues

### Issue 1: TradingView Alert Not Triggering
**Symptoms:**
- Test signals work
- No real signals in logs
- TradingView shows alert as active

**Solution:**
- Check alert condition logic
- Verify indicator is plotting bias correctly
- Test alert manually in TradingView

### Issue 2: Signal Parsing Error
**Symptoms:**
- Webhook logs show received data
- Processing logs show failures
- Error message in failures log

**Solution:**
- Check signal format matches expected pattern
- Review error message in `/api/webhook-failures`
- Verify price format is numeric

### Issue 3: Database Connection Issue
**Symptoms:**
- Signals received but not stored
- Database errors in logs

**Solution:**
- Check database connection: `python -c "from database.railway_db import RailwayDB; RailwayDB()"`
- Verify tables exist: `python init_webhook_debug.py`
- Check database credentials

## Log Patterns

### Successful Bearish Signal
```
üî• WEBHOOK RECEIVED: SIGNAL:Bearish:20500:75:ALIGNED:ALIGNED:2024-01-15T10:00:00
üìä PARSED SIGNAL: bias=Bearish, symbol=NQ1!, price=20500.0, htf=ALIGNED
‚úÖ Signal stored: NQ1! Bearish at 20500.0 | Strength: 0% | Session: NY AM
```

### Failed Signal
```
üî• WEBHOOK RECEIVED: [malformed data]
‚ùå ERROR capturing live signal: Invalid price format
```

### Missing Signal Type
```
‚ö†Ô∏è HEALTH ALERT: No bearish signals in last hour
```

## Monitoring Best Practices

1. **Check dashboard every hour** during trading hours
2. **Monitor health alerts** for missing signal types
3. **Review failure logs** daily
4. **Test both signal types** weekly
5. **Verify TradingView alerts** are triggering

## Success Metrics

‚úÖ **Healthy System:**
- Both signal types received in last hour
- Success rate > 95%
- No health alerts
- Balanced signal ratio (roughly 50/50)

‚ùå **Problem Indicators:**
- Only one signal type in last hour
- Success rate < 90%
- Health alerts present
- Large imbalance in signal ratio
