# Database Resilience System Monitoring

## How to Check if Resilient System is Working

### Simple Status Check
```
GET https://your-app.railway.app/api/db-status
```

**Healthy Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "query_time_ms": 45,
  "signals_last_hour": 12,
  "resilient_system": "active",
  "message": "Database connection healthy"
}
```

**Error Response (System Auto-Recovering):**
```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "error": "connection lost",
  "resilient_system": "attempting_recovery",
  "message": "Resilient system will auto-recover"
}
```

## What the Resilient System Does

1. **Automatic Reconnection** - If connection dies, reconnects automatically
2. **Transaction Cleanup** - Rolls back aborted transactions before every request
3. **Connection Pooling** - Maintains 2-20 healthy connections
4. **Query Retry** - Retries failed queries up to 3 times

## How You'll Know It's Working

✅ **Pages keep loading** even after database hiccups
✅ **No manual restarts needed** when connections fail
✅ **Logs show reconnections** but pages stay up
✅ **`/api/db-status` returns healthy** most of the time

## When to Worry

🔴 **All pages fail to load** - Railway PostgreSQL is down
🔴 **`/api/db-status` returns error for >5 minutes** - Check Railway logs
🔴 **Constant reconnections in logs** - Network instability

## Railway Logs to Watch

```bash
✅ Database reconnected
✅ Transaction rolled back
✅ Connection pool active
❌ Reconnection failed (after 3 attempts)
```

## The Bottom Line

**If your pages load, the resilient system is working.** You don't need a fancy dashboard - just check if Signal Lab, ML Hub, and other pages load normally. That's the real test.
