# Refocused Roadmap - Data-Driven Strategy Discovery

**Goal:** Leave AWS, trade prop firms full-time for massive profits  
**Strategy:** Let data reveal the optimal trading approach over 6-12 months  
**Current Status:** Data collection engine operational ✅

---

## 🎯 Core Philosophy

**You don't know the best strategy yet - and that's OK!**

Your indicator generates signals, but you need to discover:
- Which sessions have best expectancy?
- Which HTF alignments are most profitable?
- Which timeframes work best?
- What's the optimal risk management approach?
- When to trade BE=1 vs No-BE?

**The platform's job:** Collect data passively while you build the business infrastructure.

---

## 📊 Two-Track Approach

### TRACK 1: Data Collection (Background - Passive)
**Goal:** Let signals accumulate for 6-12 months  
**Status:** ✅ OPERATIONAL (Automated Signals Dashboard + Hybrid Sync)  
**Effort:** Minimal (already built)

**What Happens:**
- Automated Signals Dashboard collects every signal
- Hybrid Sync ensures 100% data completeness
- Data accumulates: 50 signals/month → 300-600 signals in 6-12 months
- You review data periodically to identify patterns

**No active work needed - just let it run!**

---

### TRACK 2: Business Infrastructure (Active - Build)
**Goal:** Prepare for multi-prop-firm trading business  
**Status:** ⏳ NEEDS WORK  
**Effort:** 3-6 months of focused development

**What to Build:**
- Prop firm management tools
- Risk management system
- Multi-account dashboard
- Performance tracking
- Compliance monitoring
- Financial reporting

**This is where you spend your development time!**

## 💡 Key Insights from Your Clarification

### 1. You're in Discovery Mode ✅
**Correct Approach:**
- Don't force a strategy before data proves it
- Let signals accumulate naturally
- Review data periodically
- Adjust approach based on evidence

**Wrong Approach:**
- Assume you know the best strategy
- Build automation before validation
- Optimize prematurely

**Your approach is correct!**

---

### 2. Automated Signals Dashboard is the Core ✅
**What It Does:**
- Collects every signal automatically
- Tracks complete lifecycle
- Captures all relevant data (session, HTF, MFE, etc.)
- Enables future analysis

**Status:** ✅ OPERATIONAL (with Hybrid Sync)

**Action:** Let it run! This is your data goldmine.

---

### 3. Parallel Development is Smart ✅
**While data accumulates (passive):**
- Build prop firm management tools
- Prepare for multi-account operations
- Create professional business infrastructure

**Why This Works:**
- Data collection doesn't need your attention
- Use the time productively
- When data is ready, business tools are ready
- No wasted time waiting

**Your approach is correct!**

---

### 4. Strategy Discovery Takes Time ✅
**Reality:**
- 50 signals: Too early for conclusions
- 150 signals: Patterns start emerging
- 300 signals: Clear trends visible
- 500+ signals: Statistical significance

**Timeline:** 6-12 months of data collection

**Your patience is correct!**

---

## 🚨 What NOT to Build

### ❌ ML Automation (Yet)
**Why:** You don't know what to automate yet!
- Need to discover optimal strategy first
- Then automate that strategy
- Not automate before knowing what works

**When to Build:** Month 12+ (after strategy validated)

---

### ❌ Real-Time Data Integration (Yet)
**Why:** Current data quality is sufficient for discovery
- TradingView 1-minute bars are fine
- Not hitting rate limits
- Expensive ($100-300/month)

**When to Build:** Month 12+ (when scaling to 24/7 automation)

---

### ❌ Advanced ML Features (Yet)
**Why:** Need basic strategy first
- Regime detection requires knowing what works
- Predictive models need validated strategy
- Feature engineering needs clear targets

**When to Build:** Month 12+ (after strategy proven)

---

### ❌ Infrastructure Scaling (Ever?)
**Why:** Single-user platform
- No need for multi-region
- No need for load balancing
- No need for auto-scaling

**When to Build:** Only if building SaaS product (not your goal)
