## üîß How It Works

### **Automatic Rule Application:**
1. User selects one or more prop firms
2. System identifies strictest rules among selected firms
3. Automatically updates filter inputs:
   - Max Daily Loss (%)
   - Max Drawdown (%)
4. Shows active rules summary
5. Filters strategies to only show compatible ones

### **Multi-Firm Selection:**
- Select multiple firms to find strategies that work across all
- System applies the **strictest** rule from all selected
- Example: Select My Funded (0% daily) + FundedNext (2.4% daily) = Uses 2.4%

### **Smart Filtering:**
- Firms with 0% daily loss are treated as "no limit"
- When mixed with firms that have limits, the limit applies
- Drawdown calculations respect end-of-day vs intraday trailing
